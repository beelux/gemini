### What's Gemini?
[Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) is an internet protocol; similar to Gopher or HTTP, it is lighter than the modern web, but heavier than Gopher.

It doesn't strive to replace any of the two, but instead tries to provide a "stripped down web" or "modernized Gopher". [0]

It also mandates the use of TLS encryption, and uses a markup language known as "Gemtext".

#### Powered by titan2

[titan2](https://gitlab.com/lostleonardo/titan2) is a minimal Gemini server written in Go. (<160 LOC)

While there are other servers out there, titan2 is a very lightweight server, that's stripped down to the bare minimum.
Exactly what we need for our static capsule.

#### Gemini clients
["The" Gemini site](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/) lists a variety of clients.
One of the most popular ones is the terminal client [Amfora](https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/amfora).
It is available on many Linux distributions, macOS, as well as Windows.
